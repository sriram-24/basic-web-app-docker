This repo is a learning repo for docker and kubernetes. It contains my learning experience of building an application and deployment.

### Installing

For installation you need [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). 

For database setup follow database.md file. 

After setting up database you can directly run the below command. 
```bash
docker compose up
```

The application contains 3 components 
- Database (postgres)
- Server (express)
- Client (nextjs)
